        <p>Improved Customer Engagement − Current analytics suffer from blind-spots and
            significant flaws inaccuracy; and as noted, engagement remains passive. IoT completely
            transforms this to achieve richer and more effective engagement with audiences.</p>
        <p>Technology Optimization − The same technologies and data which improve the customer
            experience also improve device use, and aid in more potent improvements to technology.
            IoT unlocks a world of critical functional and field data.</p>
        <p>Reduced Waste − IoT makes areas of improvement clear. Current analytics give us
            superficial insight, but IoT provides real-world information leading to the more effective
            management of resources.</p>
        <p>Enhanced Data Collection − Modern data collection suffers from its limitations and its
            design for passive use. IoT breaks it out of those spaces and places it exactly where
            humans really want to go to analyze our world. It allows an accurate picture of everything.</p>
