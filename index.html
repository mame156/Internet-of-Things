    <p>1. Sensing Layer - The main purpose of the sensing layer is to identify any phenomena in the devices’ peripheral and obtain data from the real world.
        This layer consists of several sensors. Using multiple sensors for applications is one of the primary features of IoT devices. Sensors in IoT devices are
        usually integrated through sensor hubs. A sensor hub is a common connection point for multiple sensors that accumulate and forward sensor data to
        the processing unit of a device.
        Actuators can also intervene to change the physical conditions that generate the data. An actuator might, for example, shut off a power supply, adjust an airflow valve, or move a robotic gripper in an
        assembly process. Sensors in IoT devices can be classified into three broad categories as described below:
        A. Motion Sensors: Motion sensors measure the change in motion as well as the orientation
        of the devices. There are two types of motions one can observe in a device: linear and
        angular motions. The linear motion refers to the linear displacement of an IoT device while the angular motion refers to the rotational displacement of the device.
        Architecture of IoT
        B. Environmental Sensors: Sensors such as Light sensors, Pressure sensors, etc. are
        embedded in IoT devices to sense the change in environmental parameters in the
        device’s peripheral. The primary purpose of using environmental sensors in IoT devices is to help the devices to take autonomous decisions according to the changes of a
        device’s peripheral. For instance, environment sensors are used in many applications to
        improve user experience (e.g., home automation systems, smart locks, smart lights, etc.).
        C. Position sensors: Position sensors of IoT devices deal with the physical position and
        location of the device. The most common position sensors used in IoT devices are
        magnetic sensors and Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors. Magnetic sensors are
        usually used as digital compass and help to fix the orientation of the device display. On
        the other hand, GPS is used for navigation purposes in IoT devices.</p>
    <p>2. Network Layer - The network layer acts as a communication channel to transfer data, collected
        in the sensing layer, to other connected devices. In IoT devices, the network layer is
        implemented by using diverse communication technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, ZWave, LoRa, cellular network, etc.) to allow data flow between other devices within the same
        network.</p>
    <p>3. Data Processing Layer - The data processing layer consists of the main data processing unit
        of IoT devices. The data processing layer takes data collected in the sensing layer and analyses
        the data to make decisions based on the result. In some IoT devices (e.g., smartwatch, smart
        home hub, etc.), the data processing layer also saves the result of the previous analysis to
        improve the user experience. This layer may share the result of data processing with other
        connected devices via the network layer.</p>
    <P>4. Application Layer - The application layer implements and presents the results of the data
        processing layer to accomplish disparate applications of IoT devices. The application layer is a
        user-centric layer that executes various tasks for the users. There exist diverse IoT applications,
        which include smart transportation, smart home, personal care, healthcare, etc.</P>
