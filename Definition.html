        <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded
            with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to
            collect and exchange data. IoT is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and
            digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability
            to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer
            interaction. IoT is a network of devices that can sense, accumulate and transfer data over the
            internet without any human intervention. </p>
        <p>The Internet of Things consists of any device with an on/off switch connected to the
            Internet. This includes almost anything you can think of, ranging from cellphones to building
            maintenance to the jet engine of an airplane. Medical devices, such as a heart monitor implant or
            a biochip transponder in a farm animal, can transfer data over a network and are members of the
            IoT. If it has an off/on the switch, then it can, theoretically, be part of the system. The IoT consists
            of a gigantic network of internet-connected “things” and devices. Ring, a doorbell that links to
            your smartphone, provides an excellent example of a recent addition to the Internet of Things.
            Ring signals you when the doorbell is pressed and lets you see who it is and to speak with them.</p>
        <p>The internet of things (IoT) has found its application in several areas such as connected industry,
            smart-city, smart-home, smart-energy, connected car, smart agriculture, connected building and
            campus, health care, logistics, among other domains (see Figure 4.1). IoT systems allow users to
            achieve deeper automation, analysis, and integration within a system. They improve the reach of
            these areas and their accuracy.</p>
